# MLOps
This repository showcases my experience and learning in the field of MLOps, which is the practice of applying DevOps principles to machine learning projects. I had the opportunity to explore this field in my recent Data Science Internship at GoDigit General Insurance, where I worked on several machine learning models for different tasks. I used the open source tool MLflow to track the performance and parameters of these models, and to create an automated training pipeline for them. I also created a local ML server with the help of MLflow, and then fetched the predictions of the model using FastAPI, which is a web framework for building APIs. The repository contains three folders:
<ul>
  <li>
    Mlflow: This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks of the machine learning models that I developed and trained using MLflow.
  </li>
  <li>
    Intel: This folder contains information about MLflow, MLOps, and FastAPI, which are the tools and concepts that I used and learned in this project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mlops: This folder contains the code and files for creating the local ML server and fetching the predictions from it using FastAPI.
  </li>
</ul>
