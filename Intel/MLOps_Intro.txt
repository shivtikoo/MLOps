MLOPS

Imporving efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning models in production.  

WHAT?
A practice for managing and deploying machine learning models in production.

WORKFLOW:
Data Preparation
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Model Deployment
Model Monitoring & Maintenance
Continous Improvement

Tools & Technologies:
CLOUD PLATFORMS
CONTAINERIZATION & ORCHESTRATION TOOLS
WOKRFLOW AUTOMATION TOOLS
VCS
MONITORING & LOGGING TOOLS
TESTING & VALIDATION TOOLS

BENEFITS:
Faster time to market
Improved accuracy & performance
Scalability
Cost Saving
Compliance & Governance

Challenges in implementing MLOps:
Data Quality & Variation
Lack of standardisation
Complex and variability of ML models
Lack of standardization
Limited Expertise
Cost & Restraint constraints
Compliance and Regulatory requirements

Best Practices:
Version COntrol
Build a strong dat foundation
Automate as much as possible
Monitor and measure performance
Collaborate across teams

STREAMLINE DEVELOPMENT DEPLOYMENYT AND MANAGEMENT OF ML MODELS

THERE IS A ROAD AND NOW WE FORM THE MAP:
1.Data Gathering
2.Data Pipelining
3.EDA
4.Feature Engineering
5.Feature Selection
6.Training
7.Hyperparameter tuning
8.Deploying

Companies mai deploying v important; as need to test in different employments.

Machine Learning for IT operations
CI/CD pipeline
A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software.
